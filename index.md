| **Criteria**          | **Solar PV**          | **Fossil Fuels / Nuclear**                           |
|------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Lifecycle Emissions** | 20–60 gCO₂e/kWh       | 450–820 (Fossil), ~12 (Nuclear)                      |
| **Fuel Cost**          | None (sunlight is free) | High (fossil), Low (nuclear)                        |
| **Deployment Time**    | Months (scalable)     | 1–3 years (fossil), 10+ years (nuclear)              |
| **Waste Profile**      | Low; recyclable       | Toxic (fossil), radioactive (nuclear)                |
| **Safety Risk**        | Negligible            | Pollution (fossil), radiation (nuclear)              |
| **Scalability**        | High (modular)        | Medium to low                                        |

### Mind

[PATTERNS OF SUBCONSCIOUS RECALL: INVESTIGATING HOW THE MIND RETRIEVES AND ENCODES EXPERIENCE](https://www.necrozmalabs.com/papers/Mind_paper.pdf)


This research explores how our subconscious mind stores and recalls memories, especially those that seem to come out of nowhere. At first glance, these sudden memories might appear random — like a song playing in your head or an old childhood moment flashing back unexpectedly. But this study shows that these memories are not truly random. Instead, they follow certain hidden patterns.
