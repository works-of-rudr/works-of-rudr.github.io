## Rudr’s Work in Theoretical Physics

### Quantum Field Theory
[Unified Conscious Fields](/unified-conscious-field-theory)


The Unified Consciousness Field Theory (UCFT) proposes that reality is not composed of multiple independent quantum fields but rather emerges from a single universal field of consciousness. Unlike standard quantum field theory, which postulates separate fields for each particle type, the UCFT asserts that there is only one indivisible field underlying the entire cosmos.


### Solar Energy

NFuse represents a scalable, efficient-cost approach to high-efficiency photovoltaics, offering a clear path from scientific concept to commercial deployment.


[Critical Review on How Solar Energy Can Replace Fossil Fuels and Nuclear Power](https://www.necrozmalabs.com/papers/Critical_review_on_how_Solar_energy_can_replace_other_alternatives_like_fossil_fuels_and_nuclear_power_.pdf)
 

This paper offers a critical review of how solar energy could feasibly replace both fossil fuels and nuclear power on a large scale. We begin by explaining the fundamentals of each energy source — fossil fuels, nuclear power, and solar energy—in straightforward language. We then compare their environmental impacts, examine economic considerations, discuss technical challenges and potential solutions, and explore social and policy factors that influence large-scale adoption.                                     

### Mind

[PATTERNS OF SUBCONSCIOUS RECALL: INVESTIGATING HOW THE MIND RETRIEVES AND ENCODES EXPERIENCE](https://www.necrozmalabs.com/papers/Mind_paper.pdf)


This research explores how our subconscious mind stores and recalls memories, especially those that seem to come out of nowhere. At first glance, these sudden memories might appear random — like a song playing in your head or an old childhood moment flashing back unexpectedly. But this study shows that these memories are not truly random. Instead, they follow certain hidden patterns.
